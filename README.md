# Space_Titanic
This Jupyter notebook is my submission to the space titanic competition on kaggle where we had to predict whether a passenger get's transported to a different dimension or not based on various variables. I have performed data cleaning on the dataset to fill in various Null values, followed by feature engineering, EDA and model building.
